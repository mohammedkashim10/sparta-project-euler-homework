# sparta-project-euler-homework
### Description
Using Ruby to complete at least one (if possible, two) problems from the site [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

### Technologies used
* Ruby
* Atom text editor

### How to download
1. Link to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mohammedkashim10/sparta-project-euler-homework)
2. Click on 'Clone or download' and copy the SSH key
3. In your terminal, in your desired location, carry out the command 'git clone -SSH key-'

### Challenges
The nature of the problems really challenged me to think outside of the box when trying to tackle them. Once I figured out in my mind what I needed to do, coverting it to code in Ruby was very tricky.

### Learning points
The use of arrays to store values to use later.
